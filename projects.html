                    Sisyphus Simulator is an exciting and ambitious project that I've been working on since July 2023. This 3D role-playing game, built entirely using C# in the Unity Engine, serves as a testament to my passion and expertise in game development. I've taken on the role of project lead, handling everything from initial concept development to coding, game mechanics design, and asset integration. Throughout the development process, I've encountered and overcome various technical challenges, ensuring that the game delivers a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience. Sisyphus Simulator is a true labor of love, and I'm excited to share it with the world as it continues to evolve.
